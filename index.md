I am an Assistant Professor at the [London School of Hygiene and
Tropical Medicine](https://www.lshtm.ac.uk/aboutus/people/knight.gwen),
funded to work on the spread of antimicrobial resistance by an [MRC
Skills Development
Fellowship](https://www.mrc.ac.uk/skills-careers/fellowships/skills-
development-fellowships/).

My [research](pages/overview.html) mainly focuses how to use
mathematical modelling to better understand and hence improve the design
of interventions against antibiotic resistance. During my fellowship, I
will explore heterogeneity in antibiotic resistance, with a main focus
on carbapenem resistance in England. Alongside this work, I am
interested in the spread of methicillin resistant *Staphylococcus
aureus* (MRSA) and multi-drug resistant tuberculosis.

I previously worked at the NIHR funded
[HPRU](https://www.imperial.ac.uk/medicine/hpru-amr) for Healthcare
Associated Infections and Antimicrobial Resistance at Imperial College
London. Before that I was a postdoc with the [TB Modelling
group](http://tbmodelling.lshtm.ac.uk/) at LSHTM.
