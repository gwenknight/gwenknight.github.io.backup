### Current funding and projects

#### MRC Skills Development Fellowship: 

**Title** The dynamics of drug resistance within hospital populations of
Gram-negative bacteria

I have a 3 year Skills Development fellowship (2017-2020) to construct
mathematical models of drug resistance from the
[MRC](https://www.mrc.ac.uk/skills-careers/fellowships/skills-
development-fellowships/).

My collaborators are from Imperial College London ([Alison
Holmes](https://www.imperial.ac.uk/people/alison.holmes)), PHE ([Julie
Robotham](http://www.imperial.ac.uk/people/j.robotham), [Susan
Hopkins](https://www.imperial.ac.uk/people/s.hopkins), [Alan
Johnson](http://www.imperial.ac.uk/people/a.johnson)), Uppsala
University ([Dan
Andersson](http://www.imbim.uu.se/Research/Microbiology-immunology/
Andersson_Dan_I/)), and my mentor at LSHTM is [Graham
Medley](https://www.lshtm.ac.uk/aboutus/people/medley.graham).


#### MACOTRA

**Aim** To increase our understanding of transmission success to  better
control MRSA

**Funder** EU funded Joint Programming Initiative on Antimicrobial
Resistance (JPIAMR)

I am a collaborator on this grant which is lead by [Margreet
Vos](http://www.safety-and-security.nl/people/profdr-margreet-vos) at
Erasmus University Medical Center. Other collaborators include [Jodi
Lindsay](https://www.sgul.ac.uk/research-profiles-a-z/jodi-lindsay) at
SGUL, the University of Lyon and the Dutch National Institute for public
health and environment.

#### Modeling Infectious Diseases in Healthcare Network (MIND-Healthcare)

**Aim 1** To investigate similarities and differences in interventions
for carbapenem resistance control between the UK and USA.

**Aim 2** To develop new models of carbapenem resistance spread

**Funder** CDC

I am now an external collaborator on this grant, awarded whilst I was at Imperial College London, lead by [Eili
Klein](http://www.cddep.org/profile/eili_klein#sthash.wyshtNcw.dpbs) at
the Center for Disease Dynamics, Economics & Policy. Other collaborators
include Imperial College London ([Alison
Holmes](https://www.imperial.ac.uk/people/alison.holmes)), Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine, MathEcology,
University of Maryland.

#### Vaccines and MDR-TB

**Aim**: To estimate the heath impact, cost effectiveness and budget
impact of novel TB vaccines on MDR TB

**Funder** AERAS

I am consulting on this project lead by [Richard
White](https://www.lshtm.ac.uk/aboutus/people/white.richard).
