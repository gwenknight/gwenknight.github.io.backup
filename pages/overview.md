### Research themes

#### Heterogeneity in antimicrobial resistance

Bacterial populations are highly heterogeneous, with variation in both
underlying growth abilities and resistance levels (reflected by varying
minimum inhibitory concentrations or MICs). However, this variation is
often missing from mathematical models that aim to capture the dynamics
of antimicrobial resistance (AMR) spread or interventions for AMR
control. In this project, I am working to develop a new modelling
framework to better understand the underlying dynamics and to improve
treatment design to prevent AMR emergence. This is an extension of my
previously published [modelling
work](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4583567/) to explore
fitness variation in *Mycobacterium tuberculosis*.

#### Carbapenem resistance in UK hospitals

Carbapenem resistance is a growing problem across the UK, with
increasing numbers of proportions of infections being reported as
resistant to this last line antibiotic. My MRC fellowship aims to
explore the reasons for the variation in carbapenem resistance across
England and to use the results to target interventions for control.

My first piece of work in this area explores whether screening for patients carrying
carbapenem resistant Enterobacteriaceae should be done using a direct PCR test or 
a culture and then PCR combination. I will be presenting this at ECCMID 2018.

#### Fitness costs to resistance

The acquisition of a resistance phenotype often comes with a "fitness
cost" to the host. Determining the size of this "cost" and its impact on
the natural history of an infection is key to developing accurate
mathematical models of infectious disease spread. In this project, I am
estimating the fitness costs *in situ* of drug resistance in
*Mycobacterium tuberculosis* using detailed clinical trial data.
