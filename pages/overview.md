# My research themes

## Heterogeneity in antimicrobial resistance

Bacterial populations are highly heterogeneous, with variation in both underlying growth abilities and resistance levels (reflected by varying minimum inhibitory concentrations or MICs). 
However, this variation is often missing from mathematical models that aim to capture the dynamics of antimicrobial resistance (AMR) spread or interventions for AMR control. 
In this project, I am working to develop a new modelling framework to better understand the underlying dynamics and to improve treatment design to prevent AMR emergence. This is an extension of my previously published [modelling work](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4583567/) to explore fitness variation in *Mycobacterium tuberculosis*.

## Carbapenem resistance in UK hospitals

Carbapenem resistance is a growing problem across the UK, with increasing numbers of proportions of infections being reported as resistant to this last line antibiotic. 
My MRC fellowship aims to explore the reasons for the variation in carbapenem resistance across England and to use the results to target interventions for control.
